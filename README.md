In this project, you will create your own “Friends” table and add/delete data from it. 

1. Create a table named friends with three columns:

- `id` that stores INTEGER

- `name` that stores TEXT

- `birthday` that stores DATE
```
CREATE TABLE friends (
 id INTEGER,
 name TEXT,
 birthday DATE
);
```

2. Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends. Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.

- Insert an `id`, 
- `name`, and
- `birthday` for each of them.
